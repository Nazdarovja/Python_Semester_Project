# Python_Semester_Project

## Project Idea:

- Machine Learning with lyrics from [kaggle.com or other] to identify a songs genre by its lyrics; Input a song and get an estimation of its genre. 
- (extra?) Perhaps train it to identify the artist by a songs lyrics - if possible, might be too difficult?

### NOTES
- n-grams i bog "datascience from scraps/scratch"
- -> generere en popsang ud fra en masse lyrics.
