## About this project - "Handmade" Neural Network
 
### Project Idea
Our initial idea was to investigate, if we could build a Neural Network / Machine Learning Tool, to classify song lyrics by genre, by identifying certain characteristics about the song lyrics (features), and use these features to train our network. 

### Testing the Handmade Neural Network findings - 1
In an attempt to verify and compare our networks findings, and to gain some experience with more established Machine Learning Tools, we have implemented an existing Machine Learning Framework, Tensorflow. It is located in a Jupyter Notebook, in the "tensorflow" subfolder.

To run this notebook, navigate to the subfolder, and from your terminal of choice:
````
jupyter notebook neural_network.ipynb
````

### Testing the Handmade Neural Network findings - 2
In a further attempt to verify and compare our networks findings, and to gain more experience with Machine Learning Tools, we have implemented a [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naiv_Bayes_klassifikator). It is located in a Jupyter Notebook, in the "naive_bayes" subfolder.

To run this notebook, navigate to the subfolder, and from your terminal of choice:
````
jupyter notebook genre_classifier.ipynb
````

### Project Description and Artifacts
#### Dataset
To be able to check the identified genres form our neural network, we needed a dataset of song lyrics, with an already noted genre. Therefore, we chose to obtain a dataset of song info from kaggle.com that included just that. 

The dataset is ~100mb in size (zipped), and contains ~380,000 songs, with the information:
- song (name)
- year
- artist
- genre
- lyrics

##### Filtering of the dataset
The datset is filtered before being used in our neural network. 

- Language: We only focus on songs with English lyrics, by using a language detection library.  
- Genres: We have (arbitrarily, by the 3 largest genres) selected the following 3 genres to use:
    - Rock
    - Pop
    - Hip Hop  
- Length: We focus on songs with lyrics that are longer than 500 and less than 15,000 in characters. 
- Segment: We use 4000 random songs from each genre to train our model with (randomized), and 250 random other songs from each genre to test our model with afterwards.

#### Features
We have used a rather ad-hoc strategy to identify features from lyrics to use in our neural network, by trial and error, by intuition and by freestyling feature ideas. The networks ability to correctly classify the songs genre is directly correlated to this, and it might not be best feautes to use - we simply chose to use these:

- Word count (normalized)
- Average word length (normalized)
- Polarity
- Subjectivity
- Nouns
- Adverbs
- Verbs
